Want to get Windows Update status on a bunch of machines, only to discover the InstalledOn property is blank for lots of updates when you're using Get-HotFix or querying Win32_QuickFixEngineering class with Get-WmiObject?

Turns out it's related to PowerShell parsing the date as string to datetime object incorrectly, depending what your system locale is.

```powershell
$Updates = Get-HotFix | Select-Object description,hotfixid,installedby,@{l="InstalledOn";e={[DateTime]::Parse($_.psbase.properties["installedon"].value,$([System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::GetCultureInfo("en-US")))}}
$Updates | Sort InstalledOn -Descending | Select -First 10
```

I like the above approach, [as posted by user pyro3113](https://community.idera.com/database-tools/powershell/ask_the_experts/f/learn_powershell_from_don_jones-24/12409/get-hotfix-and-get-wmiobject-win32_quickfixengineering-missing-installedon-property/21923#21923),Â because the select expression lets you easily query remote systems using Get-HotFix or Get-WmiObject.

These two solutions use the Microsoft.Update.Session COM object. The Windows Update PowerShell Module creates the COM object on a remote host whereas the post by britv8 shows just enough to get you going executing on local host:

Interestingly, using the below command in cmd doesn't suffer from this data type parsing issue. It's just spat out as is with no interpretation.
