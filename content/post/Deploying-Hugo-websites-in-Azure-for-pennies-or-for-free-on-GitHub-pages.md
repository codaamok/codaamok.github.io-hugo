I am going to show you three ways on how to deploy your Hugo websites: Azure Static Web Apps (preview), Azure Blob storage and GitHub pages.

## What's this Hugo thing?

Hugo is a static..asdasd... but what does that really mean? asdasd

This will not be an introduction to Hugo, however here are some excellent resources to help you get started which I found great:

- [Hugo - Static Site Generator | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) YouTube series
- [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) official documentation

Why should you use Hugo? Here are a few reasons that I have learnt:

- No content management system, i.e. no database
- Zero hosting costs
- No need to touch any code, write your content in Markdown
- Manage your blog from source control
- [Wide selection of open source themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) with lots of flexibility
- Fast loading times since everything is static

I am all-for ditching WordPress. I definitely do not need it and I really do not want to pay for hosting any more. Over the last few years I have grown more comfortable with Git and working on Azure or GitHub. If you relate to that or are enticed by any of the benefits listed above, I highly recommend you at least give it a go!
